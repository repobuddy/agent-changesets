description: Use this skill when initializing or improving an AGENTS.md file with codebase documentation for AI coding assistants.
metadata:
  internal: true

Analyze this codebase and create or improve an AGENTS.md file, then symlink CLAUDE.md to it.

## AGENTS.md structure

Prefix the file with:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with code in this repository.
```

Then add sections in this order:

1. **Skill Augmentations** — always first. Use this exact content:

```markdown
## Skill Augmentations

When reading any `SKILL.md` file, always check whether a `SKILL.local.md` exists in the same directory. If it does, treat its contents as additional instructions that extend the base skill. Local augmentations take precedence over the base skill where they conflict.
```

2. **Commands** — commonly used for building, linting, and running tests, including how to run a single test.
3. **Architecture** — high-level structure that requires reading multiple files to understand. Focus on the big picture, not file listings.
4. Other sections only when grounded in existing project files (see usage notes below).

## Usage notes

- If there's already an AGENTS.md, compare each section you would add against what is already there. When content differs — not just missing, but substantively different — ask the user whether to update that section before changing it. Do not overwrite existing sections silently.
- If sections are missing entirely, add them without asking.
- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.
- Do not make up sections like "Common Development Tasks" or "Tips for Development" unless that content appears in existing project files.
- If there are Cursor rules (in `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules`) or Copilot rules (in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`), include the important parts.
- If there is a README.md, include the important parts.

## Repo-internal skills

After writing AGENTS.md, scan for repo-internal skills and mark them. For each `SKILL.md` found under `.agents/skills/`, ensure the frontmatter includes:

```yaml
metadata:
  internal: true
```

Add it if missing. This prevents these skills from being accidentally surfaced as public or globally available.

**Ongoing rule:** When writing or editing any `SKILL.md` under `.agents/skills/`, always include `metadata: internal: true` in the frontmatter.

## Ensure cyber-skills package

Check in order:

1. **Pinned npx (default)** — resolve `npm view cyber-skills version`, then `npx cyber-skills@<exact> <subcommand>` (never `@latest`, never a literal `<version>` placeholder). No `package.json` change.
2. **Existing devDependency** — if `cyber-skills` is already in `package.json`, use `pnpm exec cyber-skills` or the local bin.
3. **Optional devDependency** — when the user needs offline CLI access and the AI agent runs locally against that repo: `pnpm add -D cyber-skills`.
4. If neither npx nor a local install works, ask the user to confirm an exact pinned version or opt in to the devDependency above.

## CLAUDE.md symlink

Create the CLAUDE.md symlink. Detect the platform first:

**Unix / macOS / Linux:**

```bash
[ -f CLAUDE.md ] && ! [ -L CLAUDE.md ] && rm CLAUDE.md
ln -sf AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
if (Test-Path CLAUDE.md -PathType Leaf) { Remove-Item CLAUDE.md }
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Name CLAUDE.md -Target AGENTS.md
```

## Follow-up init skills

After init completes, discover companion `init-*` skills shipped by `cyber-skills` (for example `init-commit-discipline`):

```bash
npx cyber-skills@<version> skill list --grep 'init-*'
```

Use the same exact version pinning as in **Ensure cyber-skills package** above. If the CLI is unavailable, fall back to `skills/init-*/`, `skills.sh.json`, or `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

List any found skills with a one-line summary from each skill's description. Ask the user whether they also want to run any of them.
